## Wiki
You surely can find more details on [the wiki page](https://github.com/meness/EasyIntro/wiki).

## Include to Project
### Provide the Gradle Dependency
Add the dependency:
```gradle
dependencies {
	compile 'io.github.meness:easyintro:x.y.z'
}
```
**Note:** Replace `x.y.z` with the latest version which can be found at [releases page](https://github.com/meness/EasyIntro/releases).

Snapshots of the development version are available in [Sonatype's `snapshots` repository][snap].

### Clone or Download `.zip` file
Clone this repository or download the compressed file, then extract to your computer. Simply import the `library` module to your project.

## Usage
Create your Fragments which extend `EasyIntroFragment` and provide your desired layout resource as you always do:
```java
public class IntroOneFragment extends EasyIntroFragment {
    @Override
    public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        return inflater.inflate(R.layout.intro_one, container, false);
    }
}
```
**Note:** By extending `EasyIntroFragment` you have easier access to the intro methods and the layout bottom padding will be modified automatically.

Create an activity which extends `EasyIntro` and override the necessary `initIntro()` method:
```java
public class MyEasyIntro extends EasyIntro {
    
    // override callbacks you need
    
    @Override
    protected void initIntro() {
        // use withSlide() to add slides and
        // configure your app intro
    }
}
```
**Note:** For more details about listeners, intro settings, customizing colors, and all other things [visit wiki](https://github.com/meness/EasyIntro/wiki).

Define your activity in your `Manifest.xml`:
```xml
<activity
	android:name=".MyEasyIntro"
	android:theme="@style/EasyIntro"/>
```
**Note:** This is good to give your intro activity a theme which has `EasyIntro` as a parent.
